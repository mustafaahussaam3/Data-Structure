/*
    permutation means all the rearrangement that we can make with characters of the string 
    the possible permuation of n characters is n!

    we use tree to draw all possible cases 
    we have Back tracking -> that there is a roots that can gain another roots
    we have Brute Force -> that it can find all possibe permutations 
    ---> if the procedure has to go back and take another root so, in this we can use recursion
    so, we have to use recursion to achieve backtracking and with the help of backtracking we inform brute force 
    --> recursion that is trying to explore everything is a back tracking procedure and if the procedure is back tracking and trying to find out everything 
    then this is brute force 
    it can be done using loops also, but it will stack
